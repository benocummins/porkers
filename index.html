      <p>Hello! My name is Benjamin "Jamie" Cummins. 
      I am an accomplished senior systems engineer aspiring to transition 
      into front-end web development. Developmenet has always been a 
      passion and the part of pretty much every job that I've enjoyed 
      the most. I've been able to automate a lot with scripting 
      throughout my systems support engineering career but 
      I'm ready to take the dive into full-time development! </p>
      <p>I'm currently beefing up my portfolio and building some real-world experience.
      In my spare time, I'm usually spending a lot of time with my wife and four kiddos.
      We enjoy home schooling our kids and spending a lot of time in nature. Feel free
      to keep up with my work here or even follow me on Github. I hope to be making good
      progress on my portfolio and plan on being working full-time for someone very soon!
      </p>
